#### Getting started with HTML
* HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
* You can use NotePad for codes and save the extension as html.

##### Creating your first HTML element
* Anatomy of an HTML element <br/>
  ```<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>```
  * `<p>` means paragraph
  * `<p>` is the opening tag
  * My cat is very grumpy is the conetnt
  * `</p>` is the closing tag
  * The whole part is the element
  Code <br/>
     ``` <em> This is my text.</em>``` <br/>
  Output <br/>
*This is my text.*
* Nesting elements <br/>
  ```<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.```</p>
  Output <br/>
  My cat is __very__ grumpy.
* Block versus inline elements <br/>
  `</p>` is a block-level element. Each *p* element appears on a new line, with space above and below. <br/>
  `<em>` is an inline element. Elements sit on the same line, with no space in between.
* Void elements
  * A void element is an element that doesn't have any content and doesn't have a closing tag <br/>
