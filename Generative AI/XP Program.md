### AI Fundamentals
* AI capabilities and technologies
  * Predictive analytics
  * Machine learning
  * NLP
  * Speech recognition
  * Virtual assistants <br>
* More advanced ones
  * Intelligent automation
    * Uses precisely programmed bots in combination of ML, NLP, and RPA to automate specific tasks within a given system
    * Examples: validating the completion of digital forms, extracting info from validating forms, and executing subsequent workflows
  * CV
  * Neural networks
  * Deep learning
    * Uses muliple layers of neural networks to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input
  * Virtual worlds
    * Combines visual graphics, physics, and AI to allow users to interact with a computer-generated environment and other users or simulate real-world situations
    * Examples: create a virtual world for a factory, simulating the assembly line and production allowing the user to change variables to test different outcomes without changing costly and time-consuming parameters in the real world.
* Digital Twin
  * Problems classes in action
    * Abstraction - extract all the physical components of an aircraft engine (e.g., specifications, dimensions) to build its "digital twin"
    * Context - once the digital twin is built, the more context that is available (e.g., ambient temperature, dust conditions, corrosive environments, weather conditions) the more accurate the simulation of the engine
    * Anomaly detection / insights and pattern recognition - determine irregularities and unanticipated events, enable issue identification, and suggest possible resolution options
    * Smart routing - issue alerts and previsely route engine parts / materials to the exact location
    * Impact - predict the likelihood of engine failure and precisely identify issue location can increase safety, improve quality, etc.
