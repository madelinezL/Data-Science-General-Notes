### Gen AI Jumpstart
* Definition: A type of AI that creates original content across various modalities (e.g. text, images, audio, code, etc.) that would have previously taken human skill and expertise to create
* AI --> DS --> ML --> DL --> Gen AI
* Foundation Models
* LLM: Large Language Models
* Prompt Engineering
* Use Cases
  * Content Generation
  * Question Answering
  * Translation
  * Personalized Avatars
  * Document Summarization
  * Named Entity Recognition
 
* Proof of Concept (PoC)
  * It is a demonstration or evidence showing the feasibility or practicality of a particular idea, concept, or project. It is a way to validate that a certain concept or approach can be successfully implemented and will peroform as intended. The primary purpose of a PoC is to assess whether the proposed solution or innovation is technically viable and can meet the specified requirements.

### Gen AI Fluency Part 1
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision
  * Use AI and CS to enable computers to interpret and understand visual information, such as image processing, pattern recognition, object detection, image segmentation, feature extraction, 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, etc.
 
* Five components of GenAI
  * Hardware
    * GPUs, TPUs
  * Cloud Infrastructure
    * AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery
  * Training Data
    * Image Data - LAION-5B dataset with over 5 million images and associated captions
    * Text Data - books, code, academic writing, medical documents, subtitles, and Wiki
  * Foundation Models
    * NLP: GPT, LLAMA, H3, Transformer XL, BRET
    * Audio: Whisper
    * CV: Florence, SAM, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
    * Code: Codex
    * Model Training
      * Traditional model - predicts the answer for the new unseen document out of list of known classes
      * Foundation model - uses the first half of the document to predict the second half of the document
  * Fine-tuned Models
  * Applications
